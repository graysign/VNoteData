该软件是基于MFC的，下载源码后一次性就可以编译通过，使用很简单。  

使用了以下开源库：  

  x264                   - H.264编码库  
  libmp3lame             - MP3编码库  
  libfaac                - AAC编码库  
  librtmp                - RTMP协议工具库  
  libsamplerate          -音频重采样库  

英文介绍原文：  
Open Broadcaster Software is free and open source software for the purposes of streaming live media content to the internet or to video files.  

Originally I just made it for myself because I thought "why should I pay a subscription for software I could probably write myself?"  

..And so, I did. And it evolved into somewhat of a monster of a project. And that's pretty much the end of the story.  

I hope people can make use of this application, or otherwise learn something from it. I'm having a ton of fun writing this software and am learning much in the process. Overall it's been an excellent experience.
